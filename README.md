# About
This is a full-stack e-commerce project built using Django, Python, HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I have created a website for 'JoyfulBookstore' that has been designed to sell childrens books and other materials such as notebooks, school supplies or art and crafts supplies.

# UX
## Strategy
Using the core UX principles I first started with Strategy, thinking about the target audience & the features they would benefit from.

The target audience for 'JoyfulBookstore' are:

- parents, relatives or friends who would like to buy books or other materials to their children/friends
- children age 0 - 18

These users will be looking for:
- An informative website, with information that is easy-to-find & concise
- A website that offers childrens books and other materials
- Ability to view & purchase books and other materials that are for sale
- Ability to make a user account in order to see billing history, make whish list and write reviews 
- A way to sign up for the bookstore newsletter

This website will offer all of these things whilst also allowing for intuitive navigation and conformability of use.
